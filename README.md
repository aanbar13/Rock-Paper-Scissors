# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This project is a fun game that can be played with a bot which randomly shoots either rock or paper or scissors. Computer vision techniques are used to capture the hand gesture of the player which then is predicted by a trained machine learning model to be one of the mentioned three options and counts the score.
